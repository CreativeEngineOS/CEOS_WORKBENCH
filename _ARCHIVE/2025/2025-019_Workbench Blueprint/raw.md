CEOS Workbench - Project Report & Development Blueprint
Document ID: CEOS_WB_REPORT_20250902
Date: September 2, 2025
Status: Stable Build v1.9.9 Achieved
Prepared By: Gemini Assistant

Part 1: After-Action Report (Development Sprint 2025-09-02)
1.1. Executive Summary
This sprint focused on hardening the core application and implementing a foundational backend for system configurations. We successfully stabilized the app, resolving a series of critical bugs related to JavaScript initialization and UI state management. A new, robust framework for handling administrative tasks was built, paving the way for the development of a logical file ingestion workflow and a dedicated _VOID document management system.

1.2. Core Achievements
Over the course of this sprint, the following key systems and features were successfully implemented and stabilized:

Fixed Critical Bugs: Resolved initialization failures caused by improper element referencing in JavaScript modules. The app now loads reliably and all core functions are stable.

Decoupled UI State: The UI now correctly handles its state, preventing multiple main panels from being visible at once. Clicking the gear icon correctly switches the central panel to a dedicated "Configuration" view.

Ingestion Workflow Foundation: The System Utilities panel is ready for its new, guided workflow. The buttons for file import and processing are now present and their visibility is correctly managed.

"Cutting Room Floor" Core: A dedicated, backend-driven _VOID document list has been created for the "My Content" panel when in settings mode. This provides a clean interface for managing rejected files.

New API Endpoints: The backend has been expanded with new API endpoints to handle administrative tasks, such as purging all _VOID files and deleting a single document permanently.

Part 2: Blueprint & Prompt for Future Development
Prompt:
As a senior full-stack developer, your task is to complete the ingestion workflow and finalize the backend administration tools for the "CEOS Workbench" based on the following specifications. The primary design philosophy is Project ATOM, meaning every component must be modular and single-purpose. Your goal is to make the ingestion process intuitive and the administrative functions clear and non-destructive.

2.1. System Architecture
The application is built around a central Python web server and a front-end UI. The file system and actors are correctly structured.

2.2. Backend Implementation (The Actors)
The server must be integrated with the following functions and features:

File Ingestion Workflow: The System Utilities box should be refactored to present a clear, three-step process.

Set Ingest Folder: A new button in the settings panel that allows the user to specify their ingest folder location. This will update the ingest_folder_path key in _LUTS/_LUT_USER_CONFIG.json.

Import Files into Ingest folder: A button that triggers a placeholder function, prompting the user to manually move files into the ingest folder. A tooltip for this button should explain that the process is non-destructive.

Process New Files: This button will remain the final, definitive step, triggering the harvester and builder actors.

"Cutting Room Floor" Management: The backend functions for purging and deleting _VOID documents are in place. The front-end must correctly call these API endpoints.

2.3. Frontend User Interface & Experience
The UI is a single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and modular JavaScript.

Ingestion Workflow UI:

The System Utilities box will have its buttons reordered to follow the new three-step process.

The "Import files" button should be visible on both the welcome panel and within the settings panel.

"Cutting Room Floor" UI:

When the app is in settings mode, the Content Archive panel's title must change to The VOID (Cutting Room Floor).

The document list in this view should be filtered to show only documents with a _VOID status.

Each _VOID document in the list should display a small "Delete" button. This button, when clicked, will send a request to the /api/settings/delete/<doc_id> endpoint.

Part 3: To-Do List (v2.0)
âœ… COMPLETED (v1.9 - Stability & Backend Foundation)

[X] Fixed critical app initialization bugs.

[X] Added Delete button functionality in the backend for individual files.

ðŸš€ NEXT BUILD (v2.0 - Finalize Ingestion & Admin)

[ ] Refactor Ingestion UI: Reorder and rename the buttons in the System Utilities box to create a clear workflow.

[ ] "The VOID" Panel: Implement the logic to display _VOID documents in a dedicated list when in settings mode.

[ ] Delete and Purge Buttons: Connect the front-end buttons to the new API endpoints for permanent file deletion.

[ ] "Set Ingest Folder": Implement a new UI and backend function to allow users to set their ingest folder dynamically.

ðŸ“‹ WISHLIST (Future Development)

[ ] Style Guide Editor: A dedicated interface for managing the terms in the Style Guide.

[ ] Auto-Generated Synopsis: An automated tool to generate a short summary for the metadata.

[ ] Visual Diffing: A tool to visually compare two versions of a document.
