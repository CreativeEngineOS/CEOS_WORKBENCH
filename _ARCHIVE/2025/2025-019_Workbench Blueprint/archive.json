  "synopsis": "This sprint focused on hardening the core application and implementing a foundational backend for system configurations. We successfully stabilized the app, resolving a series of critical bugs related to JavaScript initialization and UI state management. A new, robust framework for handling administrative tasks was built, paving the way for the development of a logical file ingestion workflow and a dedicated deleted files document management system.",
