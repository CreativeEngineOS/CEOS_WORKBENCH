## The Document Lifecycle
<br>
<br>
Every document in the Workbench moves through a clear, four-stage lifecycle. You can see a document's current stage by the colored badge in the "My Content" list.
<br>
<br>
* **`Raw`**: The initial, untouched version of the document after it has been processed. This version is a permanent record and cannot be edited. To begin work, you must click **`Create Draft`**.
<br>
<br>
* **`Draft`**: The first editable version. This is your primary workspace for writing and making initial revisions.
<br>
<br>
* **`Edited`**: A more polished version of the document. When you are finished with your main edits in the **`Draft`** stage, you click **`Promote to Edited`**. This creates a clean copy, ready for final review.
<br>
<br>
* **`Published`**: The final, locked version of the document. After a final review of the **`Edited`** version, you click **`Approve for Publish`**. This version is considered complete and is ready to be exported.
