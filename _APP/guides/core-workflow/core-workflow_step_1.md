## Editing and Managing Your Work
<br>
<br>
Once you create a **Draft**, you can begin the core writing and editing process. This guide explains the main editor and its different states.
<br>
<br>
### The Editor States
<br><br>
The editor has two primary states, controlled by a toggle switch:
<br>
<br>
* **`Preview` Mode**: This is the default, read-only mode. It's for safe viewing of your document without accidentally making changes. The text area cannot be edited.
<br>
<br>
* **`Edit` Mode**: Activating this mode makes the text area editable. The **`Save Changes`** button will appear, allowing you to save your progress at any time.
