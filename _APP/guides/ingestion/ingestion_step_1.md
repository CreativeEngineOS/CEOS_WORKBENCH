## Prepare Your Files
<br>
<br>
The first step in the **CEOS Workbench** is getting your raw text files ready. Follow these steps:
<br>
<br>
1.  **Find Your Ingest Folder**
    This is the special folder the Workbench monitors for new content. By default, it's a folder named `_INGEST` in your main project directory.
<br>
<br>
    *You can change this location in the `Settings > Configuration` panel.*
<br>
<br>
2.  **Add Your Files**
    Copy or move your `.txt`, '.md' or `.rtf` files into this ingest folder. The system will **not** touch the original files until you explicitly tell it to process them.
