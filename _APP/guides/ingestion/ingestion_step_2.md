## Process New Files
<br>
<br>
Once your files are in the ingest folder, you need to tell the Workbench to process them.
<br>
<br>
1.  **Locate the Button**
    In the main UI, find the `"System Utilities"` panel.
<br>
<br>
2.  **Click to Process Your Content**
    Click the button labeled `"2. Process New Files"`. The system will now scan the ingest folder, convert your files to a standard format, create a versioned archive, and move the originals to the `_PROCESSED` folder. You will see the new documents appear in the `"My Content"` list.
